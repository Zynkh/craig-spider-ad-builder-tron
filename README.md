============================

A little program I run from my terminal to scrape the website of an auto dealer to make craigslist ads out of.There are two versions, for when I want to grab the entire list or just a single car. Made this in the spare minutes I had between assignments and projects while I was at Lighthouse Labs. A lot to improve and clean up, but it works quite well.

* Crawls through the sites list of all cars.
* Creates a new folder on my computer for each car, the folder carrying the name, price and stock number of the car.
* Grabs all the important information about the car, spits it into a simple html template structure, and saves the html file * to the correct folder.
* Pulls all the images into the correct folder.
* Congratulates me on a job well done.

Because the dealership is kind of bad at keeping their information uniform, I had to account for a few different contingencies, which was actually pretty fun.
